    <p>Happily growing up playing video games, it has been a life long goal of mine to develop games of my own someday. While I'm a mostly self-taught 3D artist, I have completed college programs in both Game Design and Game Programming. Working towards my Game Design degree allowed me to dabble into 3D modeling and see how it fits together with everything else in the game development pipeline. With an emphasis on performance in the video game industry, I continue to practice and develop my skills in order to create optimized game ready assets.</p>
